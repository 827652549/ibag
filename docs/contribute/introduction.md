First of all, Iâ€™m sorry, this is my undergraduate graduation project, which I developed independently, and covers too deep personal ideas. But I know that my technical ability and experience are limited, and I can't design a better architecture and code logic. I will start to work next, and the time will be more limited in the future. In order to facilitate you who are involved in open source ideas, I will show all the ideas and logic in this document. I hope it will be easier to understand when you interpret the code. .

If you have better ideas and energy, especially thank you and welcome you to participate in the iteration of ibag.

Welcome to submit issue and pr.
